# Rust-Monopoly
An implementation of the Monopoly board game in Rust for my CIS 198 project

Supported Platforms:
Ubuntu (tested on 15.10 with Rust 1.8)

***IMPORTANT***
Make sure you "cargo run" in the project root directory! The board image file
will not load and the game will exit if you are not.
