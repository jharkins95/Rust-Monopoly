Rust-Monopoly
=============
An implementation of the Monopoly board game in Rust for my CIS 198 project

Supported Platforms
-------------------
Ubuntu (tested on 15.10 with Rust 1.8)

***IMPORTANT***
Make sure you "cargo run" in the project root directory! The board image file
will not load and the game will exit if you are not.

Instructions
------------
Run the game by typing 'cargo run'. You'll be prompted to enter some info into
the terminal to get the game set up. Once this is complete, click on the
drawing window and enter commands from there by typing the appropriate keys.
